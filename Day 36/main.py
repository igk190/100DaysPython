    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ 
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related 
# to the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 
# 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
#to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description 
# using list comprehension.

#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio. 



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this: 
"""

""" Learnings

1. os.getenv() is shorthand for os.environ.get(), never commit sensitive data to public repo.

2. datetime module has a "timedelta" object that lets you create spans of time. It gives you
the duration of one day and you can subtract it from datetime objects: 
yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(1)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30483977/python-get-yesterdays-date-as-a-string-in-yyyy-mm-dd-format

3. Remove sign in front of number with abs(): https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp

4. Quite challenging to access a dict key, based on a daily changing date. Implemented
a workaround with datetime.now() minus timedelta(1 or 2), formatting it the same way
as it's displayed in the API response, then inserting that as the key.

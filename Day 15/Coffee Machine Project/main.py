""" What I've learned on Day 15:

1.  At first try, I tried something like:

    for items in resources.items():
            print(items["water"])
            
    Which looks like:
    ('water', 300)
    ('milk', 200)
    ('coffee', 100)
    ('money', 0) but this doesn't show the measurement unit.
    Looking at the solution video taught me this is better: 
        print(f"Money: ${resources['money']}")
        
2. I was 'stuck' figuring out how to access and compare (!) key-value pairs from 2 dicts.
I didn't consider searching the dict VIA the user's drink. drink = menu[user_choice]. This prints latte entry.
Now we can check it's ingredients and loop through them, comparing them against resources.

Need more practice with this.

3. Once you start writing bigger chunks of code, put into separate functions! Much easier to read.

4. from solution: def make_coffee(drink_name, order_ingredients):
    for item in order_ingredients:
        resources[item] -= order_ingredients[item]. Because items are the same!

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? The for loop tries to print a range from 1 to 20. If i == 20, then the function should print
# "You got it"
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? If the upper part of the range is equal to 20, then the func should prt
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? i won't ever be equal to 20, it will stop at 19. After the loop is done, i increases
